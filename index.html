        <p class="p1">Model United Nations (MUN) conferences are immersive academic simulations where students represent various countries as delegates, tasked with addressing global issues from the perspective of their assigned nation. Throughout the event, participants engage in debates and discussions following real UN protocols, striving to find solutions to complex problems such as climate change, international security, and human rights.
